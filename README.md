 # Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
 The novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) has spread around the world very rapidly. At the time of this writing, Worldometers.info shows that there are more than 95,488 confirmed cases in more than 84 countries.
 
 The top 4 worst-affected (by far) are China (the source of the virus), South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Unfortunately, many cases are currently not reported due to:

A person can get infected without even knowing (asymptomatic)
Incorrect data reporting
Not enough test kits
The symptoms look a lot like the common flu
